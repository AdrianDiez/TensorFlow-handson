    "##### The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The\tPerceptron is one of the simples ANN architectures, invented in\t1957 by\tFrank Rosenblatt. It is based on a\tslightly different artificial\tneuron called a\tlinear threshold unit (LTU): the inputs\tand\toutput\tare numbers\tand\teach input\tconnection\tis associated with a weight. The\tLTU\tcomputes a weighted\tsum\tof\tits\tinputs $z=w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + w_nx_n=\\mathbb{w}^T\\mathbb{x}$\n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/step.png \"Step\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In their 1969 monograph titled Perceptrons, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert highlighted a number o f serious weaknesses of Perceptrons, in particular the fact that they are incapable of solving some trivia l problems (e.g., the Exclusive OR (XOR) classification problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/xor.png \"XOR\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multi-Layer Perceptron \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it turns out that some of the limitations of Perceptrons can be eliminated by stacking multipl e Perceptrons. The resulting ANN is called a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP is composed of one (passthrough) input layer, one or more layers of LTUs, called hidden layers , and one final layer of LTUs called the output layer. Every layer except the output laye r includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer. When an ANN has two or more hidden layers, it is called a deep neural network (DNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/mlp.png \"MLP\")\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years researchers struggled to find a way to train MLPs, without success. But in 1986, D. E . Rumelhart et al. published a groundbreaking article introducing the backpropagation training algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each training instance, the algorithm feeds it to the network and computes the output of every neuro n in each consecutive layer (this is the forward pass, just like when making predictions). Then it measure s the network's output error (i.e., the difference between the desired output and the actual output of th e network), and it computes how much each neuron in the last hidden layer contributed to each outpu t neuron's error. It then proceeds to measure how much of these error contributions came from each neuron in the previous hidden layer, and so on until the algorithm reaches the input layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/backpropagation.png \"Backpropagation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this algorithm to work properly, the authors made a key change to the MLP's architecture: they replaced the step function with the logistic function\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/activation.png \"Activation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP is often used for classification, with each output corresponding to a different binary class (e.g. , spam/ham, urgent/not-urgent, and so on). When the classes are exclusive (e.g., classes 0 through 9 for digit image classification), the output layer is typically modified by replacing the individual activation functions by a shared softmax function\n",
